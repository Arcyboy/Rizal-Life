            <h2>About Jose Rizal</h2>
            <p>
                Jose Rizal, a Filipino nationalist and polymath, was born on June 19, 1861,
                 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines, during the Spanish colonial period. 
                 He played a significant role in the Philippine Revolution against 
                 Spanish colonial rule through his works and activism. Here's some key 
                 information about him:

                 <ul style="display: block;">
                    <li>Early Life and Education: Rizal came from a well-educated family 
                        and was exposed to various languages and cultures from an early
                         age. He studied medicine and the arts in Manila, then continued
                          his studies in Europe, particularly in Spain, Germany, and France.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>Literary Works: Rizal was a prolific writer and intellectual.
                             He is best known for his novels, "Noli Me Tangere" 
                             (Touch Me Not) and "El Filibusterismo" (The Filibuster),
                              which exposed the injustices and abuses of Spanish colonial
                               rule in the Philippines. These novels played a significant 
                               role in shaping Filipino national identity and consciousness.</li>

                               <br>
                          <li>Activism and Reform: Rizal was deeply involved in the Filipino nationalist
                             movement. He advocated for social reforms and equality under Spanish colonial
                              rule through his writings and actions. He founded La Liga Filipina, a civic
                               organization promoting Filipino interests, and later became a member of
                                the Katipunan, a revolutionary society fighting for Philippine independence.</li>
                                <br>
                          <li>Exile and Execution: Rizal's activism and writings angered Spanish authorities,
                             leading to his exile from the Philippines. He spent several years in exile in
                              various parts of Europe before returning to the Philippines briefly. In 1896,
                               he was arrested by Spanish authorities on charges of rebellion, sedition,
                                and conspiracy. He was executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, 
                                at the age of 35, in Manila.</li>
                                <br>
                          <li> Legacy: Jose Rizal is considered a national hero in the Philippines for his
                             contributions to the country's struggle for independence and his advocacy for 
                             social justice, education, and national identity. His martyrdom inspired 
                             subsequent generations of Filipinos in their fight for freedom and democracy.</li>

            <h2>Works</h2>
            <p>
                Rizal's works include novels such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, which are considered some of the most important works in Filipino literature.



                <ul style="display: block;">
                    <li>Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not):
                        Published in 1887, "Noli Me Tangere" is Rizal's first novel and is
                         considered one of the most influential works of Philippine literature.
                          It exposed the injustices and abuses of Spanish colonial rule in the
                           Philippines, particularly the oppressive social system and religious 
                           hypocrisy. The novel follows the story of Juan Crisostomo Ibarra,
                            a young Filipino who returns to the Philippines from Europe, only
                             to witness the corruption and oppression prevalent in his homeland.</li>
                             <br>

                    <li>El Filibusterismo (The Filibuster):
                    Published in 1891 as a sequel to "Noli Me Tangere," "El Filibusterismo" delves deeper into the themes
                     of social injustice and oppression. The novel explores the consequences of colonial abuses and the failure 
                    of peaceful reform efforts, ultimately leading to a tragic and violent conclusion. Like its predecessor,
                     "El Filibusterismo" is a scathing critique of Spanish colonial rule and its impact on Filipino society.</li>
                     <br>
                    <li>Mi Ultimo Adios (My Last Farewell):
                    Written on the eve of his execution, "Mi Ultimo Adios" is Rizal's farewell poem to his beloved
                     homeland, the Philippines. It expresses his love for his country and his willingness to 
                     sacrifice his life for its freedom and independence. The poem has become one of the most iconic
                      and revered works of Philippine literature, symbolizing Rizal's martyrdom and his enduring 
                      legacy as a national hero.</li>
                      <br>
                    <li>Essays and Articles:
                        Rizal was also a prolific essayist and journalist, writing numerous articles and essays on
                         a wide range of topics, including education, politics, history, and culture. His essays,
                          such as "The Indolence of the Filipino," "The Philippines A Century Hence," and "To the
                           Filipino Youth," continue to be studied and discussed for their insights into Philippine 
                           society and the challenges facing the Filipino people.</li>
                           <br>
                    <li>Poetry:
                Rizal was a talented poet who wrote poetry in both Spanish and Tagalog. His poems, such as "Sa Aking Mga Kabata" 
                (To My Fellow Children) and "A La Juventud Filipina" (To the Filipino Youth), reflect his love for his country
                and his hopes for its future. His poetry celebrates the beauty of the Philippines and the resilience of its people 
                in the face of adversity.</li>
